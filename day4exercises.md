#Day 4 Exercises

##Exercise 1 - Hashmap

1. Include a HashMap in the “benchmark”-test from exercise 8a from Day1) using the method put(key, value). 

Are the execution times obtained in agreement with the growth rate _O_(1)?

2. Write a program which inserts the string values "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"... up to "nine" under keys 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...,9.

3. The retrive the strings stored under keys 7, 9, 3 and print out their values.

4. Change the order in which the key-value pairs were inserted in 1). Does that change the output in 2.?

5. Add an other HashMap, which maps the keys "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"... up to "nine" to the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...,9. 

6. Retrieve the values stored under "one", "five", "seven".

##Exercise 2  (Collections class - efficiency)

Compare execution times for the method Collecions.sort() for two large collections

1.	ArrayList 
2.	LinkedList

Do you expect one of the collections to be sorted fastest?
Do your observations agree with your expectations?

Read the documentation for the implementation of the sort() method. In some versions of Java, the list is copied to an array before sorting. What does this imply for the execution times?  


##Exercise 3  (Utilizing Java Collection Framework)

Create an algorithm for eliminating duplicates from a list of elements (i.e. integers)
Consider which kind of collection can be applied to simplify the task.


##Exercise 4  (Tree Sort)

Implement the tree sort algorithm by utilizing the Binary Tree class from a previous exercise.
 
You need to make some extensions for traversing the Binary Tree class.


##Exercise 5 (Catch up on exercises from the previous days on Collections)
