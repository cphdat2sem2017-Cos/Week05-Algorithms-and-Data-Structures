# 5th week of the 2nd semester
Topics: Algorithms and Data Structure

###Readings:

* [Theory of algorithms & big-O notation](study/ComparingAlgorithms-ComplexityTheory.pdf)

An alternative document to read wich covers approximately the same curriculum is [Peter Sestofts note on Search and Sort](study/SestoftSearchAndSort.pdf)

##Day 1 - Basic Algorithms and Efficiency/Collection Framework
The goal is to get an understanding of how one views efficiency of computer programs and basic data structures.

* [Complexity](study/complexity.md)
* [Java Collection Framework1](http://beginnersbook.com/java-collections-tutorials/)
* [Java Collection Framework2](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_collections.htm)
* [LinkedList](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_linkedlist_class.htm)

###Exercises:
* [Exercises for day1](study/day1exercises.md)

###Other Resources:

[Other resources](study/OtherResources.md)


##Day 2 - Recursion & binary trees
The goal is to be able to work with recursion - and in particular exemplified by binary trees.


###Readings:
The video's from Lynda.com gives the basics.

* [Binary tree](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-tree-data-structures/149042/177132-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) and [Binary Search Tree](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Understanding-binary-search-trees-BST/149042/177133-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) are well explained in these two sections at Linda.com

###Exercises:
* [Exercises from day2](study/day2excercises.md)

##Day 3 - Recursive sorting algorithms
Sorting is one of the most important fundamental issues in computing - we will look at some of the recursive sorting algorithms.
In particular we will look at merge sort and quick sort.

### Readings for quicksort


* [Animation](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/)

### Readings for mergesort


* [Animation](http://visualgo.net/sorting) - pick merge sort

### Exercises
[Exercises for day3](day3exercises.md)


##Day 4 - HashTale/Hash map & Recap
Today we will work on a few more algorithms and data structures to ground the previous few days.

### Readings
* [Hashing & Hashmaps](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-associative-arrays/149042/177125-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) - this section and the next two (three sections total "Using associative arrays", "Understanding hash functions" and "Using hash tables").

### Exercises
* [Exercises for day4](day4exercises.md)
* [Extra hard exercises](day4red.md)
 

##Day 5 - [Studypoint exercise](day5StudypointExercise.md)
